# Dynamic Quote Generator
Directory: `dom-manipulation`

A small vanilla-JS project that generates quotes, lets users add quotes, and filter by category.

## Usage
- Open `index.html` in a browser.
- Click "Show New Quote" to see a random quote.
- Add a quote using the text boxes and click "Add Quote".
- Use the category dropdown to filter quotes.

## Optional enhancements
- Persist quotes to `localStorage` so added quotes remain after refresh.
- Add edit/delete controls next to each quote.
- Add basic animations (fade-in).
